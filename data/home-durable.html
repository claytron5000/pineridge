The burner starts with a 12 gage steel shell. The plenum portion of the
shell is separated from the burner block by a .25" steel baffle plate.
This plate is welded solid inside the shell at all points, completely
eliminating any potential for leakage between the block/shell
interface. The alloy steel metering orifices are press fit into the
baffle plate and extend well up into the burner block. This insures
dependable, accurate fuel mixture delivery throughout the life of the
burner. The burner block itself is a cast refractory with a maximum
recommended use temperature of 3100 degrees Fahrenheit. It is specially
formulated to withstand repeated heating/cooling cycles. The burner
block is 5" deep, with 2" invested into the steel shell and another 3"
extending beyond the shell. These burners are workhorses, designed to
deliver years of dependable service in the most demanding production
situations.
