Most burners on the market are of the "retention tip" type. The
fuel/air mixture passes straight through the burner and into the firing
chamber. Retention tips do help improve flame stability and give a
focused spot heat, but they do little to improve the fuel/air mix and
they can be noisy. The Pine Ridge Burner is not a retention tip. The
fuel/air mix first enters a chamber called a plenum. This plenum is
baffled to further asdfasjdmix the fuel and air. (The better the fuel/air mix,
the better the burn). This improved fuel/air mix then exits the plenum
through a series of alloy steel metering orifices. The metering
orifices accurately supply the fuel/air mix to a honeycomb of larger
delivery orifices in the burner head. Burning the fuel through many
orifices spreads the heat out evenly over a wide area. It also makes
the burner very quiet. The Pine Ridge Burner is often referred to as a
"ribbon burner" because it creates a "ribbon" of flame.
