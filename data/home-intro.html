1987 Pine Ridge Enterprises introduced their new line of burners. The
burner design accomplished three main objectives: efficient fuel
consumption, low operating noise level, and long term reliability.
Capable of reaching temperatures in excess of 2700 degrees Fahrenheit
and whisper quiet, these burners quickly became a favorite with glass
factories and hot glass studio artists. In recent years the burners
have become increasingly popular with metal artists, blacksmiths, and
other industries that require high temperature processes.

<p>After over 20 years, Pine Ridge Burners have earned a reputation
for being one of the best built, longest lasting burners on the
market. In fact, some of the original burners are still in service.
Today there are hundreds of our burners in daily use in over 20
countries world-wide.
